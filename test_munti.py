"""Phase 1 correctness gate. Run this before spending a single GPU hour.

    python test_munti.py

No pytest, no fixtures — plain asserts, runs on CPU in well under a minute.
It uses synthetic token ids, so it needs no dataset and no tokenizer.

The tests, in order of how much time they save you:

  1. overfit    the real gate. 4 fixed batches, memorized to loss < 0.05 and
                parroted back verbatim. If the model or the loop is miswired,
                this fails here in seconds instead of after 6 GPU hours.
  2. causality  perturbing token t must not change any logit at position < t.
                A broken causal mask leaks the answer, so training loss looks
                great and generation is gibberish — the nastiest silent bug in
                a transformer, and invisible without a test like this one.
  3. init loss  ~ln(vocab_size) at initialization. Catches a dead head or a
                mis-shaped output projection.
  4. fast==slow the fused attention kernel and the reference implementation
                must agree, so the speed switch can never change results.
